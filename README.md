Hub for academic deadlines.

## Submitting New Deadlines

To submit new deadlines, please follow these instructions:

1. **Edit the [`data/deadlines.json`](https://github.com/mr-devs/deadline-hub/blob/main/data/deadlines.json) file only**: All new deadlines should be added to the `data/deadlines.json` file. Any other edits, unless explicitly addressing an issue, will be denied.

2. **Use the OpenAI GPT for formatting**: To ensure consistency in formatting, use the OpenAI GPT that we have created. You can access it [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67c62a6497d081918a7d0de2d1267137-deadline-hub-data-extractor).

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you have made your changes to the `data/deadlines.json` file, submit a pull request for review. Please make sure to explain your changes.
